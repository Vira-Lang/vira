1) How You Can Contribute

Vira is a collaborative effort â€” thereâ€™s always room to help:

Fix a bug or unexpected behavior.

Improve documentation or write examples/tutorials.

Add or refine tests.

Contribute to the compiler, parser, CLI, or runtime (the project uses Rust, Zig, Go, and JavaScript).

Propose and discuss new language features.


If youâ€™re not sure where to start, look for issues labeled good first issue or help wanted, or open a discussion to share your ideas.

2) Setting Up the Environment

Hereâ€™s a simple setup workflow â€” adjust it for your OS and preferred components.

1. Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/Vira-Lang/vira.git
cd vira

2. If working with Rust components:



rustup toolchain install stable
rustup default stable
cargo build --workspace
cargo test

3. If working with Zig components: Install the required Zig version (check project docs for specifics), then build using:



zig build

4. If working with JavaScript / Node parts:



cd <your_js_folder>
npm install
npm test

Explore the folders compiler, parser_lexer, cli, examples, and installation to understand the projectâ€™s structure and build scripts.

> If something doesnâ€™t work, please include details about your OS, compiler versions, and toolchains in your issue â€” it helps us reproduce and fix problems quickly.

3) Reporting Issues â€” Be Specific

A clear and detailed issue makes it much easier to solve.

Include:

Title: concise and descriptive (parser: crash on string interpolation).

Description: what happened, what you expected to happen.

Steps to reproduce: minimal reproducible example.

Environment: OS, Rust/Zig/Node versions.

Logs/output: compiler messages, stack traces, or command output.


Template (you can copy this into your issue):

### Description
Brief explanation of the problem.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

### Expected Behavior
...

### Logs / Output
(Include relevant compiler messages)

### Environment
- OS:
- Rust / Zig / Node version:

4) Working on Code & Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch:



git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

2. Keep your change focused on a single topic (e.g., parser fix, not parser + CLI refactor).


3. Write tests â€” unit or integration â€” to verify your change.


4. Make clear, meaningful commits:



module: short summary

Example:
fix(parser): handle escaped quotes in strings

5. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR):



Explain what your PR does, why, and how to test it.

Link related issues (Fixes #42).

Tag maintainers or reviewers if you know them.


PR Checklist

[ ] References an issue (if applicable)

[ ] Includes or updates tests

[ ] Passes local builds and CI

[ ] Updates docs or examples if needed



---

5) Code Style, Tests, and CI

We value consistency and clarity:

Rust: use rustfmt and clippy.

Zig / JS / Go: follow their official formatters (zig fmt, gofmt, prettier or eslint).

Keep PRs small and well-scoped â€” large refactors are best split into separate PRs.


> If CI fails, check the logs first. If you canâ€™t reproduce the failure locally, describe your environment and paste the failing output in your PR.




---

6) Security and Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security issue or vulnerability:

Do not open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainers privately via GitHub or email (see repository ownerâ€™s profile).

Include detailed reproduction steps and describe potential impact.


Weâ€™ll handle the disclosure responsibly and credit your contribution appropriately.

7) FAQ & Support

Q: Iâ€™m new to Rust/Zig/Go â€” can I still help?
Absolutely! Documentation, tests, and examples are great starting points. Weâ€™re happy to mentor first-time contributors.

Q: How long do reviews take?
Depends on the complexity and maintainer availability â€” small PRs are usually reviewed faster. Be patient and responsive to feedback.

Q: Can I propose large architectural changes?
Yes, but please open a discussion or issue first to align with maintainers. Major changes should include a migration plan and rationale.

Community Guidelines

Be respectful and constructive â€” weâ€™re all here to learn.

Keep discussions technical and friendly.

Disagreement is fine, but always explain your reasoning clearly.

Mark issues as good first issue if youâ€™d like to mentor newcomers.
